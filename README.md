# Moving-Average Trading Strategy Backtest

A Python implementation and backtest of a 50/200-day moving-average crossover trading strategy, developed to explore the effectiveness of momentum-based signals in equity markets.

## Overview
This project simulates a simple trend-following strategy that goes **long** when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average and **exits** when it crosses below.  
It measures returns, risk, and performance metrics over a 10-year period using historical data from the yfinance API.
